1)Isomorphic Strings

  https://leetcode.com/problems/isomorphic-strings/description/
  
  Given two strings s and t, determine if they are isomorphic.
  Two strings s and t are isomorphic if the characters in s can be replaced to get t.
  All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. 
  No two characters may map to the same character, but a character may map to itself.
  
2)Is Subsequence

  https://leetcode.com/problems/is-subsequence/description/
  
  Given two strings s and t, return true if s is a subsequence of t, or false otherwise.
  A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative       positions of the remaining characters.
  (i.e., "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).
  
3)Verifying an Alien Dictionary 
      
  https://leetcode.com/problems/verifying-an-alien-dictionary/description/
  
  In an alien language, surprisingly, they also use English lowercase letters, but possibly in a different order. 
  The order of the alphabet is some permutation of lowercase letters.
  Given a sequence of words written in the alien language, and the order of the alphabet,
  return true if and only if the given words are sorted lexicographically in this alien language.
