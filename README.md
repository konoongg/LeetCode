1)Isomorphic Strings

  https://leetcode.com/problems/isomorphic-strings/description/
  Given two strings s and t, determine if they are isomorphic.
  Two strings s and t are isomorphic if the characters in s can be replaced to get t.
  All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. 
  No two characters may map to the same character, but a character may map to itself.
  
2) Is Subsequence
  https://leetcode.com/problems/is-subsequence/description/
  Given two strings s and t, return true if s is a subsequence of t, or false otherwise.
  A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative       positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).
