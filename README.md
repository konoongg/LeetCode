# LeetCode
1)Isomorphic Strings

  https://leetcode.com/problems/isomorphic-strings/description/
  
  Given two strings s and t, determine if they are isomorphic.
  Two strings s and t are isomorphic if the characters in s can be replaced to get t.
  All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. 
  No two characters may map to the same character, but a character may map to itself.
  
2)Is Subsequence

  https://leetcode.com/problems/is-subsequence/description/
  
  Given two strings s and t, return true if s is a subsequence of t, or false otherwise.
  A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative       positions of the remaining characters.
  (i.e., "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).
  
3)Verifying an Alien Dictionary 
      
  https://leetcode.com/problems/verifying-an-alien-dictionary/description/
  
  In an alien language, surprisingly, they also use English lowercase letters, but possibly in a different order. 
  The order of the alphabet is some permutation of lowercase letters.
  Given a sequence of words written in the alien language, and the order of the alphabet,
  return true if and only if the given words are sorted lexicographically in this alien language.
  
4)Contains Duplicate

  https://leetcode.com/problems/contains-duplicate/description/
  
  Given an integer array nums, return true if any value appears at least twice in the array,
  and return false if every element is distinct.
  
5)Find Pivot Index

  https://leetcode.com/problems/find-pivot-index/description/
  
  Given an array of integers nums, calculate the pivot index of this array.
  The pivot index is the index where the sum of all the numbers strictly to the left of the index is equal to the sum of all the numbers strictly to the index's right.
  If the index is on the left edge of the array, then the left sum is 0 because there are no elements to the left. This also applies to the right edge of the array.
  Return the leftmost pivot index. If no such index exists, return -1.
